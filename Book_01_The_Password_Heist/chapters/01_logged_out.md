📘 **Firewall Force: The Password Heist**

### 📍 Scene 1 – Digital Academy Cafeteria

### Chapter 1: Logged Out

The bell rang at Digital Academy, but Jax didn’t move.

The cafeteria buzzed with noise — metal trays clanked, sneakers squeaked, and someone’s speaker played chiptune beats from their backpack. But Jax was frozen in front of his school-issued laptop.

> **"Incorrect password. Try again."**

That was attempt number… eight? Maybe nine.  
He knew he hadn’t forgotten it. He never did.  
**LaserBeams42!** — it was burned into his brain.

And yet…

🔒 **Locked out.**

Even weirder? The “Forgot Password” link wasn’t working. It kept refreshing the page. Every time he clicked, it just blinked. Like it was mocking him.

“You good, dude?”  
It was Nova, sliding into the seat across from him, balanced on one chair leg like she was born in defiance of gravity.

“I think I’ve been hacked.”

“Oh?” she said, cocking an eyebrow. “And here I thought you were just bad at typing.”

He flipped the screen around. There it was. Same error.  
And now, a second tab was blinking.

His email was open.  
A sent message — **3:04 a.m.**  
Subject: _“How to Delete the School System in One Click 💣”_  
Sent to **every teacher.**

Nova leaned in. She wasn’t grinning anymore.

> “Okay… that’s not a typo.”

---

Nova gave him a long stare. Not accusing, just thinking. Then she tilted her head.

“Where was your laptop last night?”

Jax blinked. “In my backpack.”

“Unzipped?”

He opened his mouth, closed it again.

“You left it in the library, didn’t you?”

Jax winced. “Just for a minute! I went to get my water bottle from the gym. There were like three people there—”

> “Three people and ten thousand open attack vectors,” Nova muttered.

She reached across the table and opened the laptop again.  
“We need to check for traces. Look at the logs, see if someone accessed your account remotely, or—”

📲 **Principal Derwin**  
“Jax: Please report to my office. Now.”

Jax swallowed. Nova whistled low.

> “Guess word travels fast.”

---

Jax stared at his phone like it might rewrite the message if he waited long enough.

“You gotta go,” Nova said, already standing. “Stall him. Be clueless.”

“Gee, thanks.”

She grinned. “You’re great at that.”

Jax packed up his laptop, slid his hoodie on, and started toward the admin wing. Every step felt like it echoed across the school.  
He wasn’t scared—well, maybe a little—but mostly annoyed.  
If someone had framed him, they’d picked the wrong target.

He wasn’t just a tech nerd.  
**He was Firewall Force.**

---

Meanwhile, Nova was already on the move.

She ducked behind the nearest wall and pulled out her phone, tapping fast.

📲 **GROUP PING:** `[CODE YELLOW] – Meet in STEM closet. 3 mins. Bring tools.`

Lena replied instantly:  
> “On it.”

Zee replied with a **pixelated skull** made of lines of code.  
_Hacker approved._

Three minutes later, in the half-lit supply closet between robotics and the janitor’s closet, Firewall Force was in session.

Lena popped a USB drive into her laptop.  
> “I ghost-copied the student email logs last week when they updated the web client.”

Zee was already digging into Jax’s browser history on the shared school profile.

> “No login attempts last night,” he muttered. “But someone accessed his account from the library terminal.”

Nova’s eyes narrowed.  
> “So he didn’t do it. That proves it.”

“Not quite,” Lena said. “We need something cleaner. Timestamps. IP logs. Maybe even a screenshot.”

Nova crossed her arms, thinking.  
> “Then we better get it before they reimage his machine. Or worse… before he gets suspended.”

📍 **Location:** Digital Academy – IT Room, 3rd Floor (Restricted Access)

The hallway outside the server room was quiet — except for the low hum of vents and the occasional squeak of Zee’s rolling toolbox.

Nova crouched beside the door, scanning the lock panel.  
> “You sure this will work?”

Zee popped a flash drive into a dongle, into an adapter, into a suspicious-looking device covered in stickers.  
> “I was born sure.”

✅ **Click.**  
The LED flashed green. The door unlocked with a soft thunk.

> “We’ve got five minutes before the night scripts auto-wipe temp logs,” Lena whispered.

They slipped inside. The room was dim, filled with the glow of blinking switches and soft fan whirs — like a **tech jungle**.

Zee headed straight to the access terminal.  
> “Logging in under admin fallback profile. They never patched it. Classic.”

Nova scanned the desktop while Lena mirrored the logs onto an encrypted stick.

> “I’ve got timestamps,” Lena said. “Jax’s account was accessed from the library machine… but only for 43 seconds.”

> “Weirdly fast,” Zee muttered. “Too fast.”

He tapped through session data.  
> “Wait… this wasn’t someone logging in manually.”

> “What was it?”

> “It was a script. A script that injected the login, sent the email, and wiped itself.”

Nova’s eyes widened.  
> “That’s next-level.”

“And look at this,” Lena added, turning her screen.  
> “The session originated from a device that doesn’t exist. MAC address is scrambled.”

---

Suddenly, a low hum turned into a sharp beep.  
Then another.  
Then lights.

🚨 **Flashing red.**  
On the walls.  
On the server racks.  
On the laptop.

> “Intrusion detected,” said a robotic voice overhead.  
> “Security lockdown in progress.”

> “We’re toast,” Zee said, yanking his drive out mid-transfer.

> “Out. Now!” Lena snapped, slamming her laptop shut.

They bolted for the hallway, Nova in front, Zee locking the door behind them as fast as he’d unlocked it. Nova ducked behind the nearest stairwell just as two security drones rolled past — glowing blue, recording, scanning.

> “They’re using drones now?” she hissed.

> “Derwin’s been watching too much Netflix,” Zee muttered.

They sprinted down the back hall toward Robotics, where Zee had a hidden panel rigged behind a vending machine.

> “In here,” he said, popping the latch with a magnet.  
> “Server room’s gonna auto-report the breach in 90 seconds. After that… we’re locked out for good.”

Nova’s pulse was still racing.  
> “We got what we needed?” she asked Lena.

Lena nodded, but didn’t look sure.  
> “Most of it. We’ll have to analyze offline. Whatever we just tripped… Nullroot wanted us to.”

📍 **Location:** Digital Academy – Rooftop Access (Unofficial Club Hideout)

Jax slumped against the rooftop wall, hoodie pulled tight, heart still hammering from the principal’s office.

He hadn’t been suspended.  
But he was officially “under review.”  
His account was disabled, and he was banned from tech labs for 72 hours.

It felt like a **digital prison sentence.**

Then came the **thump** of a hatch door.

Nova, Lena, and Zee climbed out of the stairwell, looking like they’d just finished a boss battle in a firewall factory.

Nova tossed him a juice pouch.  
> “You owe me three sprint drills for missing this mission,” she said, sitting down beside him.

> “What’d you get?” Jax asked.

Zee plugged a drive into a portable screen. It flickered, then loaded a minimalist command prompt.  
Lena typed a line.

> “We traced the attack to a non-existent machine. MAC address was spoofed. Session lasted 43 seconds. Entire login + email was sent via injected script.”

> “Okay…” Jax said slowly. “So I was hacked.”

Nova smiled.  
> “We knew that. The question is… by who?”

The screen flashed again. This time with an ASCII image forming slowly.

🐰 A crude digital rabbit — with goggles.

Underneath it, a message:

> “Nice try, Firewall Force. But you’re already inside. – Nullroot”

They all stared.

Zee blinked.  
> “Okay, what?”

Lena looked at Jax.  
> “Whatever this is… it’s personal.”
