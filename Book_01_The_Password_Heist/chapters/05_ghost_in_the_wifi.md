### Chapter 5: Ghost in the Wi-Fi

⸻

### 📍 Scene 1 – Digital Academy, Monday Morning – Hallway Near STEM Lab

Zee was upside down. Literally.

His sneakers were wedged into an overhead vent as he dangled by a rope harness they "borrowed" from gym class.

> "A little to the left," Nova said, squinting up at him.

> "My *left* or the router's left?" Zee groaned, twisting.

Below, Jax was holding a laptop with a live signal scan running. Lena tapped the screen, watching the bars dance.

> "You’re in range. The ghost AP is broadcasting from *inside* the wall."

> "Well, that’s unsettling," Jax muttered.

Zee flicked open a panel and yanked out a dusty access point, blinking faint blue. A second later, the Wi-Fi signal on Lena's screen dropped to zero.

> "Boom. Disarmed."

> "One down," Nova said. "Three more to find."

Jax sighed. "Why is Nullroot always five steps ahead?"

> "Because he's not playing fair," Lena said. "He's playing *weird*."

### 📍 Scene 2 – Arcade HQ, Later That Day

The arcade buzzed as they reviewed footage from the past 48 hours. Infrared maps. Network spikes. MAC address collisions.

Nova pointed to a heat signature on screen.

> "That ghost AP in the hallway? It pulsed at the exact same time as the vending machine rebooted."

Jax frowned. "That thing eats my dollars all the time. You telling me it’s... sentient?"

> "I’m saying Nullroot hijacked it. He turned school junk into a covert relay network."

Lena's keyboard clacked. "He didn't build a network. He built *noise*."

> "White noise," Zee added. "To hide signal jumps. We’re not just tracing pings. We’re tracing echoes."

Nova leaned forward.

> "Then it’s time to echo back."

### 📍 Scene 3 – Recon Run: Vending Machine Caper

Lena distracted the hall monitor with a fake fire drill printout. Nova popped the vending machine hatch with a magnetic key.

Zee crawled under, flashlight in mouth.

> "Yup. Nullroot spliced a USB Wi-Fi card into the logic board. It’s spoofing the school’s main SSID."

> "Cut it?" Jax asked over comms.

> "Better," Zee said. *Snip.* *Snap.* "I’m giving it a firmware stutter. If Nullroot tries to access it, we’ll bounce his own signal back at him."

Nova grinned. "So he’ll be ghosted by his own ghost network."

> "Exactly. Let’s spook the spook."

⸻

### 📍 Scene 4 – Rooftop HQ, That Night

The team watched as Nullroot’s latest signal pinged in.

Then, for the first time—it *looped.*

Zee snapped his fingers. "He took the bait."

Lena isolated the bounce. "We've got coordinates."

> "Where?" Jax asked.

Lena looked up. "The faculty parking lot."

Nova stood, eyes wide. "Nullroot’s not remote. He’s *here*."

They all grabbed their gear.

> "Firewall Force, mount up," Nova said.
