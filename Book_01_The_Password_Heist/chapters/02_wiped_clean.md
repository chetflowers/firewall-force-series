Firewall Force: The Password Heist

Chapter 2: Wiped Clean

⸻

Scene 1 – Digital Academy, Saturday. 06:47 a.m.

Jax couldn’t sleep.

Not after that message.
Not after seeing a glitchy ASCII symbol blink at him like it knew his next three moves.

He slipped into the school through the side entrance — badge cloned, camera loop engaged. If anyone asked, he was running a robotics project. Technically true.

But today wasn’t about robots.
Today was about finding out who just walked all over his digital life.

Or, as Nova would call it:
“Post-Breach Threat Attribution. Level 3.”

⸻

Location: Server Room (Again)
The red lockdown lights were gone. Everything looked normal.
Too normal.

Jax logged in using a burner profile Zee had slipped him last fall.

Just in case.

He opened the temp log archive Lena had mentioned after the breach.

Nothing.

No session history.
No event flags.
No trace the laptop had ever even existed.

“They wiped it,” Jax muttered. “Clean.”

He checked /var/cache.
Then /tmp.
Then the shadow directory Zee taught him to find with a stacked alias command.

Still nothing.
Except…

One folder.
Hidden.
Named _ffghost.sys

Inside?
A single audio file:

tunnel-access.mp3

He double-clicked it.

The voice was masked, distorted — but calm. Almost amused.

“You’re not the only one hunting ghosts, Jax. Keep digging.”

⸻

GROUP PING: [CODE GREEN] – HQ meet. 10 minutes. Rooftop access.

Zee dropped a new file into their shared drive:

recon-report-v1.bin

Nova was already at HQ sipping iced coffee and sketching out their next move on the whiteboard.

Lena was decoding metadata from the server snapshot.

Firewall Force wasn’t just reacting anymore.
They were investigating.

Scene 2 – Nova’s Operation: Drone Dive

Location: Digital Academy – Maintenance Office

Nova slid a borrowed tablet across the desk, flipped open the port hatch, and connected her cable rig.

“Time to see what you saw, little drone.”

The school’s security drones weren’t AI-smart, but they logged everything: video, heat signatures, MAC addresses, access attempts.

She ran Zee’s drone-log decryption script.

PASSWORD: ilookupilockdown
ACCESS GRANTED.

⸻

Video logs played in reverse.
She scrubbed back to the server room breach.

There: a blur of movement, infrared signatures of three students.
Firewall Force, in and out, clean.

But just after they left…

The drone pivoted on its own.
Just slightly. Toward a shadow in the hallway.

Someone was standing there.
Still. Watching.

The drone’s motion sensors didn’t tag them.
Their face was blurred. Heat signature masked.

“Who are you…” Nova whispered.

She tapped into the raw telemetry.

Ping. Ping. Ping.
One signal — completely outside the school’s network — was bouncing through a spoofed AP.

Nova leaned closer. The frequency wasn’t school-issued.

“You’re tunneling through a ghost signal…”

She saved the data and pushed it to the team drive.

phantom-ping-001.log

Then she did something reckless.

She pinged it back.

⸻

A moment later, a message popped up on the tablet.

“Nice move. But I don’t chase shadows.”

Then it vanished.

The signal dropped.
The tunnel closed.

Nova sat back, heart pounding.

“Well, now we know someone’s watching.”

⸻

Scene 3 – HQ: Signal Hunting

Location: Firewall Force HQ – Rooftop Arcade

The old arcade smelled like dust, circuit boards, and ancient bubble gum.
Exactly how Jax liked it.

Zee had just rolled in with a USB full of drone logs. Nova was already sketching the layout of the third-floor hallway on the whiteboard. Lena was typing at light speed.

“Okay,” Nova said, spinning around in her chair. “I pinged back the mystery signal.”

“You what?” Jax asked, eyes wide.

“Just a light tap,” she said. “But I got a message: ‘I don’t chase shadows.’ Then the signal dropped.”

Lena looked up from her screen.

“It was tunneling through a spoofed AP.”

Zee nodded, arms crossed.

“Wi-Fi access point like that doesn’t show up unless someone wants it to.”

Jax raised an eyebrow.

“Wait—like a fake hotspot?”

“Yeah,” Nova jumped in. “It tricks your phone into connecting, then watches everything you do. Classic attack move.”

Lena pointed to a map on her laptop.

“The spoofed AP was sitting on a channel just outside the school’s firewall. Whatever it was, it didn’t belong to the school’s network.”

“Someone was using it as a ghost signal,” Nova added. “They were watching us through the drones. And they didn’t trip any alarms.”

⸻

Jax leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling.

“We’re not just up against some troll sending prank emails,” he said.
“This is coordinated. Scripted. Clean.”

Zee’s eyes flicked to the monitor.

“Which means they’re not done.”

Lena hit Enter.

phantom-ping-001.log – Uploaded.
Analyzing packet structure…

“If I can isolate the handshake pattern,” she said, “I might be able to trace the real source. But I’ll need time.”

“You’ve got it,” Jax said.
“Everyone else — stay frosty.”

GROUP PING – CODE YELLOW

Status: External Network Activity Detected
Next Move: Unknown

Scene 4 – Nullroot’s Fingerprint

Location: HQ – 12 minutes later

“Guys,” Zee said. “We’ve got a problem.”

The monitor in front of him had frozen.
Then blinked.
Then every system in HQ rebooted — one by one.

BEEP.
BOOP.
CRUNCHHZZZ…

Jax dropped his juice pouch. “What just happened?”

Lena looked up from her laptop. “It’s not us.”

The arcade’s overhead lights flickered. CRT monitors sparked on and off like haunted eyes. Nova stepped back from the breaker box.

“This isn’t power. It’s data.”

⸻

One screen stayed on.

A single file was open.

MESSAGE.TMP

Zee opened it.

Lines of raw code scrolled, then stopped on a blinking block cursor.
Then a single word burned into the screen:

EXECUTING

A moment later, music began to play.

Choppy, warped, but unmistakable.

It was the school’s anthem.
But reversed. Slowed.
Like it was… rotting.

And underneath it, text appeared:

“You trace ghosts. I write them.
The next script’s already running.” – Nullroot

Nova’s face went pale.

“We’re being warned.”

Jax stood.

“No. We’re being invited.”
