Firewall Force: The Password Heist

Chapter 3: Operation Honeypot

⸻

Location: HQ – 3 hours post-injection

“You ever bait a black hat?” Zee asked, spinning a pen like a knife.

Jax raised an eyebrow. “No, but I’ve trapped raccoons in the garage.”

Lena didn’t look up. “Same principle. Dangle something shiny. Watch what shows up.”

Operation Honeypot was go.

They were building a fake student profile from scratch:
• New login credentials
• A “misplaced” shared folder
• A planted spreadsheet labeled:
admin_passwords_2025_draft.xlsx

It was wrapped in metadata so sloppy, it would make a script kiddie salivate.

⸻

Nova smirked.

“You think he’s dumb enough to go for something this obvious?”

“I’m counting on it,” Lena said. “Sometimes the best trap is the one that looks too easy.”

Zee set up a watchdog script — a passive listener wired to the fake account.
If anyone touched it?

Pings. Alerts. Timestamps.
Even a backscatter bounce from the attacker’s IP — assuming they slipped.

Nova synced the honeypot to the school network through a sandboxed container.

Jax stood back and crossed his arms.

“This is either going to be brilliant… or we’re about to get laughed out of the darknet.”

⸻

GROUP PING: [CODE GREEN] – Honeypot active. Sitrep in 2 hours.

⸻

Location: Digital Academy – Cafeteria, the next day

Nothing.
Nada.
Crickets.

“Maybe Nullroot’s smarter than we thought,” Nova said.

“Maybe he’s scared,” Jax replied, biting into a stale bagel.

Lena was quiet.

Zee scanned logs with a far-off look in his eye.

“Something’s… off.”

⸻

“Define off?” Nova asked.

Zee turned his laptop to show the dashboard.

honeypot_status: NORMAL
ping_count: 0
file_accessed: FALSE
script_triggered: FALSE

But underneath all that — hidden in the debug window — a single line:

user-agent: [null-agent-v0.0.0]

“That’s not real,” Lena whispered.
“That’s… spoofed.”

“He didn’t take the bait,” Zee said. “He rewrote it.”

⸻

Back at HQ, their server logs were clean. Too clean.

“He buried something,” Jax said. “Something in our own trap.”

Nova froze.

“Pull the honeypot. Now.”

Zee slammed the kill switch.
Logs streamed in — delayed, fragmented.

One file uploaded itself to the team drive with no origin trace:

thanksfortheinvite.txt

They opened it.

Just one line:

“Nice setup. Mind if I stay a while?” – Nullroot

Jax slammed his fist on the table.

“He’s inside our bait. And he’s laughing.”

⸻

Nova stood.

“Next time, we don’t set a trap.”

“Next time,” Lena added, “we build a cage.”

Zee nodded.

“Nullroot’s in the system. But he’s not invisible anymore.”

“And he thinks this is a game,” Jax said.
“Let’s change the rules.”

⸻

GROUP PING: [CODE ORANGE] – Firewall Force moving to active recon. Nullroot compromised honeypot integrity. Counter-op required.
