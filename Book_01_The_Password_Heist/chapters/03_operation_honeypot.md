📘 **Firewall Force: The Password Heist**

### Chapter 3: Operation Honeypot

⸻

### 📍 Location: HQ – 3 hours post-injection

> “You ever bait a black hat?” Zee asked, spinning a pen like a knife.

> “No, but I’ve trapped raccoons in the garage,” Jax replied.

> “Same principle,” Lena muttered. “Dangle something shiny. Watch what shows up.”

🎯 Operation Honeypot was go.

They were building a fake student profile from scratch:  
• New login credentials  
• A “misplaced” shared folder  
• A planted spreadsheet labeled:  
`admin_passwords_2025_draft.xlsx`

It was wrapped in metadata so sloppy, it would make a script kiddie salivate.

Nova smirked.  
> “You think he’s dumb enough to go for something this obvious?”

> “I’m counting on it,” Lena said. “Sometimes the best trap is the one that looks too easy.”

Zee set up a watchdog script — a passive listener wired to the fake account.  
If anyone touched it?

📶 Pings.  
🕒 Alerts.  
📅 Timestamps.  
Even a backscatter bounce from the attacker’s IP — assuming they slipped.

Nova synced the honeypot to the school network through a sandboxed container.

Jax stood back and crossed his arms.  
> “This is either going to be brilliant… or we’re about to get laughed out of the darknet.”

📲 **GROUP PING: [CODE GREEN] – Honeypot active. Sitrep in 2 hours.**

### 📍 Location: Digital Academy – Cafeteria, the next day

Nothing.  
Nada.  
Crickets.

> “Maybe Nullroot’s smarter than we thought,” Nova said.

> “Maybe he’s scared,” Jax replied, biting into a stale bagel.

Lena was quiet.  
Zee scanned logs with a far-off look in his eye.

> “Something’s… off.”

⸻

> “Define off?” Nova asked.

Zee turned his laptop to show the dashboard:

```
honeypot_status: NORMAL  
ping_count: 0  
file_accessed: FALSE  
script_triggered: FALSE
```

But underneath all that — hidden in the debug window — a single line:

```
user-agent: [null-agent-v0.0.0]
```

> “That’s not real,” Lena whispered.  
> “That’s… spoofed.”

> “He didn’t take the bait,” Zee said. “He rewrote it.”

⸻

Back at HQ, their server logs were clean.  
Too clean.

> “He buried something,” Jax said. “Something in our own trap.”

Nova froze.  
> “Pull the honeypot. Now.”

Zee slammed the kill switch.  
Logs streamed in — delayed, fragmented.

One file uploaded itself to the team drive with no origin trace:

📁 `thanksfortheinvite.txt`

They opened it.  
Just one line:

> “Nice setup. Mind if I stay a while?” – Nullroot

💢 Jax slammed his fist on the table.  
> “He’s inside our bait. And he’s laughing.”

Nova stood.  
> “Next time, we don’t set a trap.”

> “Next time,” Lena added, “we build a cage.”

Zee nodded.  
> “Nullroot’s in the system. But he’s not invisible anymore.”

> “And he thinks this is a game,” Jax said.  
> “Let’s change the rules.”
