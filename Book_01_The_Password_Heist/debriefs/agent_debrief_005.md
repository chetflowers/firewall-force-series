📁 **Filed by:** Firewall Force HQ  
📡 **Status:** Rogue Device Found. Distributed Network Detected.

### THREAT PROFILE:

A compromised access point was found embedded in a vending machine, broadcasting a nearly identical SSID to the school’s real network. The device was part of a **mesh network** planted across campus to track student behavior and device traffic — all routed back to Nullroot.

### TACTICS EXPLAINED:

- **Rogue AP (Access Point):** A fake Wi-Fi signal that mimics a trusted network to steal data or mislead users.
- **Mesh Network:** A group of connected nodes that pass data between each other — like walkie-talkies that never shut up.
- **SSID Impersonation:** A slight change in the Wi-Fi network name designed to fool users or devices into auto-connecting.

### FIREWALL FORCE RECOMMENDS:

✅ Double-check Wi-Fi names before connecting  
✅ Disable auto-connect to public networks  
✅ Use VPNs to encrypt traffic  
✅ Report weird behavior (like snacks that buzz)  
✅ Avoid plugging unknown devices into school systems

### AGENT TRIVIA:

Some rogue APs are so sneaky, your phone will connect to them automatically — just because they use a name your device "remembers" from another location.  
_It's like trusting someone just because they’re wearing your friend’s hat.
