AGENT DEBRIEF 001 – The Password Heist

Filed by: Firewall Force HQ
Status: Investigated. Exfiltrated. Ongoing Threat Detected.

⸻

THREAT PROFILE:

A scripted brute-force attack was launched against a student account. The attacker used an auto-injection script, spoofed MAC address, and false login to impersonate the student and send a mass email from their device.

⸻

TACTICS EXPLAINED:
• Brute-force attack:
Rapid-fire guessing of thousands of password combos to crack an account

• Spoofed MAC address:
A fake device ID used to hide the attacker’s hardware identity

• Auto-injection script:
A program that mimics someone logging in — but faster, sneakier, and silent

⸻

FIREWALL FORCE RECOMMENDS:
• Use strong passwords (12+ characters, include symbols & no pet names)
• Don’t reuse the same password for multiple accounts
• Never leave your laptop or phone unlocked and unattended
• Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible
• Use a password manager to store and generate secure logins

⸻

AGENT TRIVIA:

The password “123456” is still the most common in the world.
(If that’s yours… change it. Like, right now.)
