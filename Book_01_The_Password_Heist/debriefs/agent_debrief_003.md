AGENT DEBRIEF 003 – Honeypot Hijack

Filed by: Firewall Force HQ
Status: Trap Bypassed. Intrusion Confirmed.

⸻

THREAT PROFILE:

The squad set a honeypot trap to bait Nullroot. Instead, he spoofed a user-agent, bypassed 
their system, and left a taunting file behind.

⸻

TACTICS EXPLAINED:
• Honeypot: A fake target to bait attackers and monitor behavior
• Sandbox: A safe, isolated space where dangerous files are trapped
• Spoofing: Faking information to trick systems or hide identity

⸻

FIREWALL FORCE RECOMMENDS:
• Monitor traps from the outside, not just inside
• Run integrity checks on files and scripts
• Never underestimate your adversary — even fake files can be real threats

⸻

AGENT TRIVIA:

Spoofed user-agents can mimic Chrome, Safari, or even made-up browsers — and some malware uses them as coded messages.
