AGENT DEBRIEF 002 – Spoofed Signals & Digital Shadows

Filed by: Firewall Force HQ
Status: Infiltration Detected. Source Masked.

⸻

THREAT PROFILE:

An attacker tunneled into the school’s systems using a spoofed access point (AP) — a fake Wi-Fi signal 
designed to trick devices into connecting automatically.

⸻

TACTICS EXPLAINED:
• Spoofed AP: A fake Wi-Fi that mimics a real one to intercept your traffic
• Ghost Signal: A stealthy, hidden network that slips past basic scans
• Ping Back: Nova sent a signal to the ghost network and got a message in return

⸻

FIREWALL FORCE RECOMMENDS:
• Turn off auto-connect to Wi-Fi on all devices
• Verify network names before joining
• Use VPNs for encrypted traffic
• Never click suspicious files from unknown sources

⸻

AGENT TRIVIA:

The first known spoofed hotspot was used in 2005 at a hacker conference — it looked like “Starbucks Wi-Fi,”
but really logged every keystroke.
