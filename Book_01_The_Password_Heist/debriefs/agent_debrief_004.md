🛡️ AGENT DEBRIEF 004 – Proxy Puppet

📍 Filed by: Firewall Force HQ
📊 Status: Local Node Identified. Puppet Compromised. Nullroot Active On-Site.

⸻

THREAT PROFILE:

A student device was remotely hijacked and turned into a command shell via a disguised update. Nullroot used this device to launch a script attack and cover his tracks.

⸻

TACTICS EXPLAINED:
• 🧠 Proxy Shell: A remote access tunnel that uses legitimate apps or processes to control a system unnoticed.
• 🔁 Signal Bounce: Routing commands through other locations (like Switzerland) to mask origin.
• 🎣 Echo Trap: Sending a fake packet to lure a response and trace an attacker.

⸻

FIREWALL FORCE RECOMMENDS:
• 📱 Audit software updates—especially on school-issued devices.
• 🔎 Watch for hidden network activity (ping spikes, device delays).
• 🛑 Don’t assume “low access” users aren’t targets. Everyone’s a potential puppet.

⸻

AGENT TRIVIA:

🎭 Nullroot spoofed a dictionary app to tunnel control signals.
Even study tools can be trojan horses.
